# 📊 Student Performance Analysis — Regression & Classification

This project explores student exam data using both **regression** and **classification** techniques to analyze and predict academic performance.

---

## 🔍 Objectives

- **Regression:** Predict a student’s math score using reading and writing scores.
- **Classification:** Predict whether a student will **pass or fail** based on their average exam score.

---

## 🧠 Models Used

- 🧮 **Linear Regression** – For predicting math scores.
- 🌳 **Decision Tree Classifier** – For pass/fail classification.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

---

## 📈 Visualizations

- ✅ Scatter plot of average score vs math score, colored by pass/fail
- ✅ Confusion Matrix

---

## 📂 Dataset

- Based on the [Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)
